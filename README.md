# Python-for-Embedded-and-IoT

This repository is for basic introductory course for 
getting started with Embedded and IoT Development using Python

## Why Python ?

When it comes to embedded and IoT Development, it has mainly dominated 

by low level programming language mainly C/C++ and Assembly due to their

lower memory management capability but its changing now Python is taking a 

leap and become one of top language for IoT and Embedded Development


## Supported Micro-controllers 

- Raspberry Pi 
- MicroPython
- ESP8266
- Arduino 


## Ways to controlling Arduino with Python ?

- Standard Firmata Protocol
- PySerial 


## IoT Development

Here once we learn how to control the micro-controllers with Python

we gonna see how to make everything connected 

#### Requirements 

You can actually use you're favorite web framework to link your 

micro-controllers to cloud but for this tutorial we gonna use **flask**. 

- Flask or (Django/Fastapi)
- ngrok (To make a local port accessible over cloud)
